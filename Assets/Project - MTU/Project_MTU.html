          Qur’an to the general audience. This invitation was accepted by the
          Mufti Shafi Usmani on the condition that he would not accept any
          remuneration for this service and that his lectures would be broadcast
          without any interference by the editing authorities. The permanent

          the Holy Qur’an) and it was broadcast every Friday morning on the
